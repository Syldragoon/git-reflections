What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
We create a new versioned repo in order to be able to use versioner.
This is used when no central repository is already existing.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area allows to select next files to commit.
It allows to be more flexible than repository but allows as well to prepare next files from working directory to versionize.
