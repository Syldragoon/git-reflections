When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaboration is needed: this is suitable in most of cases! :)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This allows to know the current version of the working directory: by having automatic sync with the remote, it would be a mess.
Moreover, the local repo can be used offline; this feature is not compatible with automatic sync.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: clone of repos inside GitHub: to use while working on other existing repos on GitHub, to use to contribute
Clones: clone from GitHub repo to local or from local to local: to use locally with own working environment
Branches: last commit originated from common ancestor commit: to use one specific tasks in order to make easier context switching
